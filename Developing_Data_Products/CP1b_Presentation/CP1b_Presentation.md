How do we do it?

- Our secret formula (shhhh, don't tell anyone!) lies in the Motor Trend magazine's database of fine motorcars.
    - Extensive listing of thirty-two (32) cars from 1974
    - Over ten (10) meticulously curated details for each car
- Here's a sample of this comprehensive database:


```
