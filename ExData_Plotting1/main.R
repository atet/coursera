# Goal: Make plots, examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007.
#   Your task is to reconstruct the following 4 plots below, all of which were constructed using
#   the base plotting system.
# Instuctions:
# 1. We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02.
# 2. Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
# 3. Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.
# 4. Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot,
#      i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code
#      for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also include
#      the code that creates the PNG file.
# 5. Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository
