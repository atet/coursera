## NOTE: I am submitting this early, but seeing how this is a public repos, anyone can see it right away.
## If you need help, you can use this as a guide to understanding the problem, but please do not just copy/paste this code.
## R has a steep learning curve, but you will get it with time and experience, I have faith in you.
