# Impact Analysis of Severe Weather Events on Population and Economic Health in the United States: Wind- and Rain-related Most Damaging from 1950-2011

**NOTE: I am submitting this early, but seeing how this is a public repository, anyone can see it right away. If you need help, you can use this as a guide to understanding the problem, but please do not just copy/paste this code. R has a steep learning curve, but you will get it with time and experience, I have faith in you.**

## 1. Synopsis

"Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern."

Here, using the dataset from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database (which tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including dates, locations, and estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage), types of weather events were examined to determine which were most harmful to U.S. population health and had the greatest national economic consequence. According to the data, wind-related events have impacted the population the most while rain-related events have resulted in the most crop and property damages.

## 2. Data Processing

A GitHub repository was created for this document at: https://github.com/atet/coursera/tree/master/RepData_PeerAssessment2

### 2.A Loading Data

The original required data file archive `repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2` is downloaded from the course website and uncompressed locally:

```{r load_bz2, eval=FALSE}

setwd("~/")
filepath_source      <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2"
filepath_destination <- "~/repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2"
download.file(url = filepath_source, destfile = filepath_destination, method = "curl")
data                 <- bzfile(description = filepath_destination)
# This may take a while!!!
data                 <- read.csv(data, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) # Remember to set stringsAsFactors = FALSE
# Saving out as compressed R object (*.rds) for convenience (in case the file needs to be loaded again, will take R less time)
saveRDS(data, "~/repdata-data-StormData.rds")

```

Reload the dataset from the R object compressed form:

```{r load_rds}

data <- readRDS("~/repdata-data-StormData.rds")

```

This large dataset initially contains 902,297 observations with 37 variables each as seen below:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

str(data)

```

Supplementary data: Census data of U.S. population by county from 1900-1990 from the National Bureau of Economic Research ([http://www.nber.org/census/pop/cencounts.csv](http://www.nber.org/census/pop/cencounts.csv)):
    
```{r load_supplemental1a, eval=FALSE}

# Download file from source to local
download.file(url = "http://www.nber.org/census/pop/cencounts.csv", destfile = "~/cencounts.csv")

``` 

```{r load_supplemental1b}

# Load the downloaded file
us_population <- read.csv(file = "~/cencounts.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) 

```

### 2.B Cleaning Data

**2.B.i Date and time**

Date and time entries are from 16 different time zones, Universal Time Coordinated offsets for each of these timezones were determined from Wikipedia.org ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zones)):

```{r, results='asis'}

time_zones <- data.frame(
  "Abbreviation" = c(
    "SCT","GST","UTC","AST","ADT","EST","EDT",
    "CST","CDT","MST","MDT","PST","PDT","HST","SST"),
  "Description" = c(
    "Seychelles Time","Gulf Standard Time","Universal Time Coordinated",
    "Altantic Standard Time","Altantic Daylight Time","Eastern Standard Time",
    "Eastern Daylight Time","Central Standard Time","Central Daylight Time",
    "Mountain Standard Time","Mountain Daylight Time","Pacific Standard Time",
    "Pacific Daylight Time","Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time","Samoa Standard Time"),
  "UTC Offset" = c(
    "0400","0400","0000","-0400","-0300","-0500","-0400",
    "-0600","-0500","-0700","-0600","-0800","-0700","-1000",
    "-1100")
  )
knitr::kable(time_zones)

```

Create a uniform date/time value in UTC (Universal Time, Coordinated) of `POSIX` type using the `$BGN_DATE` and `$BGN_TIME`:

```{r, warning=FALSE}

# Trim $BGN_DATE since the date is correct, but the trailing time are all irrelevant "0:00:00""
data$date <- gsub(" 0:00:00", "", data$BGN_DATE)
# Clean up timezone $TIME_ZONE, some values need to be changed for consistency
data$TIME_ZONE[data$TIME_ZONE == "CSt"] = "CST" # Typo
data$TIME_ZONE[data$TIME_ZONE == "CSC"] = "CST" # Typo
data$TIME_ZONE[data$TIME_ZONE == "ESt"] = "EST" # Typo
data$TIME_ZONE[data$TIME_ZONE == "ESY"] = "EST" # Typo
data$TIME_ZONE[data$TIME_ZONE == "GMT"] = "UTC" # Change GMT to UTC
data$TIME_ZONE[data$TIME_ZONE == "AKS"] = "HST" # Change AKS to HST
# Nine entries have unknown "UNK" timezones, The appropriate timezone was determined based on their $COUNTYNAME and $STATE
print(data[data$TIME_ZONE == "UNK", c("date", "COUNTYNAME", "STATE", "TIME_ZONE")])
# Detrmined the correct time zones and manually added
data[data$TIME_ZONE == "UNK" & data$COUNTYNAME == "OCONEE",]$TIME_ZONE = "EDT"
data[data$TIME_ZONE == "UNK" & data$COUNTYNAME == "HAWAII",]$TIME_ZONE = "HST"
data[data$TIME_ZONE == "UNK" & data$COUNTYNAME == "COLES",]$TIME_ZONE = "CDT"
data[data$TIME_ZONE == "UNK" & data$COUNTYNAME == "RUSH",]$TIME_ZONE = "EDT"
data[data$TIME_ZONE == "UNK" & data$COUNTYNAME == "HAMPDEN",]$TIME_ZONE = "EDT"
data[data$TIME_ZONE == "UNK" & data$COUNTYNAME == "LOVE",]$TIME_ZONE = "CDT"
data[data$TIME_ZONE == "UNK" & data$COUNTYNAME == "PERKINS",]$TIME_ZONE = "MDT"
data[data$TIME_ZONE == "UNK" & data$COUNTYNAME == "MCLENNAN",]$TIME_ZONE = "CDT"
data[data$TIME_ZONE == "UNK" & data$COUNTYNAME == "ARMSTRONG",]$TIME_ZONE = "CDT"
# Merge data with UTC signed offset time from data frame time_zones
data <- merge(
  x = data, y = time_zones[,c(1,3)],
  by.x = "TIME_ZONE", by.y = "Abbreviation")
# Combine date, time, and UTC offset into a charater vector
data$datetime <- paste(data$date, data$BGN_TIME, data$UTC.Offset, sep = " ")
# Since $BGN_TIME is given in 12-hour and 24-hour format, convert everything to 24-hour format in new column $time_24
time_24h                  <- strptime(data$datetime, format="%m/%d/%Y %H%M %z")     # E.g. "8/18/1994 2322 -0300"
time_12h                  <- strptime(data$datetime, format="%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S %p %z") # E.g. "8/28/2001 12:00:00 PM -1100"
time_24h[is.na(time_24h)] <- time_12h[!is.na(time_12h)] # Will produce warning, can ignore
# Make new column time_utc
data$time_utc             <- time_24h
# NOTE: Though there are various additional issues with date and time, there will be no more subsequent cleaning here.

```

**2.B.ii Necessary variables**

Subset the source data into only columns that relate to weather event, injury/loss-of-life, and economic impact.

Including the date of the event cleaned up previously as `$time_utc`, using the documentation provided by the National Weather Service ([https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf)), the following variables relate to weather event, injury/loss-of-life, or economic impact.

```{r, results='asis'}

variables <- data.frame(
  "Variable" = c(
    "time_utc", "EVTYPE","INJURIES","FATALITIES","PROPDMG",
    "PROPDMGEXP","CROPDMG","CROPDMGEXP"),
  "Description" = c(
    "Beginning date and time of event (UTC).", "Type of event.", "Reported injuries from event", 
    "Reported deaths from event.", "Damage to property", "Property damage exponent.", 
    "Damage to agricultural crops.", "Crop damage exponent.")
  )
knitr::kable(variables)

``` 

Subset the main data into the eight variables appropriate for this analysis.

```{r}

data <- data[ , colnames(data) %in% variables$Variable] 

```

**2.B.iii Monetary values**

To determine a single monetary value for property and crop damage, `$PROPDMG`, `$PROPDMGEXP`, `$CROPDMG`, and `$CROPDMGEXP` must be deciphered and combined.

The following information is described in Section 2.7 from [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf).

The `$PROPDMG` and `$CROPDMG` values are all numerical, the corresponding `$*EXP` columns are 10^exponent multipliers for these values and the value is in U.S dollars.

Together, `$PROPDMGEXP` and `$CROPDMGEX` have 20 unique symbols as multipliers, these need to be harmonized:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

print(unique(c(data$PROPDMGEXP, data$CROPDMGEXP)))

```

Harmonize the different exponent symbols:

```{r}

# Symbols that are missing (NA), blank (""), "+", "-", or "?" will be replaced with a zero (10^0 = 1)
data$PROPDMGEXP[is.na(data$PROPDMGEXP) | data$PROPDMGEXP == "" |
  data$PROPDMGEXP == "?" | data$PROPDMGEXP == "+" | data$PROPDMGEXP == "-"] <- 0
data$CROPDMGEXP[is.na(data$CROPDMGEXP) | data$CROPDMGEXP == "" |
  data$CROPDMGEXP == "?" | data$CROPDMGEXP == "+" | data$CROPDMGEXP == "-"] <- 0
# Symbols "h" or "H" will be replaced with 2 (H = hundred = 10^2 = 100)
data$PROPDMGEXP[data$PROPDMGEXP == "h" | data$PROPDMGEXP == "H"] <- 2
data$CROPDMGEXP[data$CROPDMGEXP == "h" | data$CROPDMGEXP == "H"] <- 2
# Symbols "k" or "K" will be replaced with 3 (K = kilo = thousand = 10^3 = 1000)
data$PROPDMGEXP[data$PROPDMGEXP == "k" | data$PROPDMGEXP == "K"] <- 3
data$CROPDMGEXP[data$CROPDMGEXP == "k" | data$CROPDMGEXP == "K"] <- 3
# Symbols "m" or "M" will be replaced with 6 (M = mega = million = 10^6 = 1000000)
data$PROPDMGEXP[data$PROPDMGEXP == "m" | data$PROPDMGEXP == "M"] <- 6
data$CROPDMGEXP[data$CROPDMGEXP == "m" | data$CROPDMGEXP == "M"] <- 6
# Symbols "m" or "M" will be replaced with 9 (B = billion = 10^9 = 1000000000)
data$PROPDMGEXP[data$PROPDMGEXP == "b" | data$PROPDMGEXP == "B"] <- 9
data$CROPDMGEXP[data$CROPDMGEXP == "b" | data$CROPDMGEXP == "B"] <- 9
# The remaining symbols are already numberic and assumed correct exponents
# Make column $total_crop_damage
data$total_crop_damage <- data$CROPDMG * (10 ^ as.numeric(data$CROPDMGEXP))
# Make column $total_property_damage
data$total_property_damage <- data$PROPDMG * (10 ^ as.numeric(data$PROPDMGEXP))
# Make column $total_damage that combines the total property and crop damage
data$total_damage <- data$total_crop_damage + data$total_property_damage

```

**2.B.iv Event type**

The recorded event types are different between years (source: [http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/details.jsp?type=eventtype](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/details.jsp?type=eventtype)):
  * 1950-1955: Tornadoes
  * 1955-1996: Tornadoes, thunderstorm winds, and hail
  * 1996-present: 48 different event types

Initially, there are 985 different unique `$EVTYPE` which describe the weather event.

Clearly there are differences between labels and typos present, therefore these labels need to be harmonized.

I will only consider the following types of events (with priority):
  1. Cold-related (e.g. "GROUND BLIZZARD", "ICE STORM", "RECORD SNOWFALL", etc.)
  2. Heat-related (e.g. "EXCESSIVE HEAT", "WILD/FOREST FIRE")
  3. Coastal (e.g. "Heavy surf and wind", "Beach Erosion", "TSUNAMI", etc.)
  4. Wind-only (e.g. "High winds", "GUSTNADO", "TORNADO", etc.)
  5. Rain-only (e.g. "Mudslides", "RAPIDLY RISING WATER", "Wet Year", etc.)
  6. Other, entries with `$EVTYPE` labels that are incomplete or "?", "Summary of...", ""No Severe Weather"",  etc.

```{r}

# Replace original terms with one of the five terms using regular expressions and list of related words
# Cold-related events
data$EVTYPE[
  grepl(
    "cold|cool|snow|ice|frost|freez|icy|chill|blizzard|wint|low|glaze|fog|avalanche|avalance|hypothermia",
    data$EVTYPE, ignore.case = TRUE)
  ] <- "cold"
# Heat-related events
data$EVTYPE[
  grepl(
    "heat|high|fire|hot|warm|drought|dry|driest",
    data$EVTYPE, ignore.case = TRUE)
  ] <- "heat"
# Coastal events
data$EVTYPE[
  grepl(
    "coastal|seas|slump|beach|tsunami|current|marine|tidal|tide|hurricane|surf|typhoon|swell|spout|seiche|tropical|cstl|wave",
    data$EVTYPE, ignore.case = TRUE)
  ] <- "coastal"
# Wind-only events
data$EVTYPE[
  grepl(
    "wind|wnd|gust|dust|smoke|ash|funnel|cloud|burst|tornado|torndao|volcanic", 
    data$EVTYPE, ignore.case = TRUE)
  ] <- "wind"
# Rain-only events
data$EVTYPE[
  grepl(
    "rain|flood|fldg|storm|slide|hail|sleet|precip|stream|wet|light|lignt|cloud|tstm|fog|vog|water|shower|mix",
    data$EVTYPE, ignore.case = TRUE) 
  ] <- "rain"
# "Other" events
data$EVTYPE[
  !grepl(
    "cold|heat|coastal|wind|rain",
    data$EVTYPE, ignore.case = TRUE) 
  ] <- "other"
# Resulting distribution of events by these six different event categories
print(table(data$EVTYPE))

```
 
**For the purposes of this study, I will now consider the `data` to be harmonized, clean, and ready for analysis**.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

print(str(data))

```

**2.B.v Supplementary data**

Clean up population data: Subset needed rows and columns.
  
```{r}

# For this analysis, only considering total U.S. population in row 1 and year 1950-1990 in columns 6:10
us_population <- us_population[1,c(6:10)]

```

### 3.B Population Health Impact Resulting From Weather Events Compared to Total U.S. Population Across Decades From 1950-1990

The number of injuries and fatalities are plotted across event types by decade in Figure 2. Additionally, information regarding total U.S. population for each decade is used to normalize. Since the census data was limited to 1900-1990 and the event data only contained `wind` or `rain` catergorized events from 1950s-1990's, **therefore I will only look into dates from 1950-1999 and these two event types**.  

```{r figure2, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.show="hide", message=FALSE}

### 3.C Economic Impact Resulting From Weather Events

## 4. Discussion

**Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?**

Comparing the NOAA weather event dataset to U.S. Census population values, we can see that wind type events caused a larger impact to population health by decade when only considering rain and wind events and decades from 1950-1990. With more current U.S. Census data and more detailed pre-1996 NOAA event data, a more thorough analysis could be performed.

**Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?**

From the NOAA weather event dataset, we see that rain-related weather events have caused more total damage than other events for property and property+crop damages from 1950-2011. For total crop damages during that time, heat-related weather events resulted in the most damage. With more detailed pre-1996 NOAA event data, a more thorough analysis could be performed.
