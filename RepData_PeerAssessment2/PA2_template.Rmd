## Data Processing
  * A GitHub repository was created for this document at: https://github.com/atet/coursera/tree/master/RepData_PeerAssessment2
  * The required data file `repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2` is included in the repository.
  * Since the archive uncompressed is > 100 MB, the following code will download the archive from online, uncompress it locally, and load the local `repdata-data-StormData.csv` file into R:
```{r}
local_repos_path <- "~/github/coursera/RepData_PeerAssessment2/" # This filepath may be different for others.
bzfile(description = paste(local_repos_path, "repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2", sep = ""), exdir = local_repos_path) 
data_activity <- read.csv(paste(local_repos_path, "activity.csv", sep = ""))
```
